== SUDO is hard

*Scott*: "`I put one of those drop-in things in. Should be good to go!
But they say its not working, must be a pebkac right?`"

Scottâ€™s drop-in is in `+/etc/sudoers.d/webteam-sudo+`

Can you configure sudo to allow the `+webteam+` user to run
`+systemctl+` commands on the `+httpd+` service through sudo *without*
requiring a password? (This should include things like, start, stop,
restart, status, and reload)

Webteam user credentials *username: webteam password: redhat*
